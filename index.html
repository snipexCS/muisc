               <p>Modern K-pop "idol" culture began in the 1990s, as K-pop idol music 
                  grew into a subculture that amassed enormous fandoms of teenagers and 
                  young adults.[7][8] After a slump in early idol music, from 2003, TVXQ 
                  and BoA started a new generation of K-pop idols that broke the music genre 
                  into the neighboring Japanese market and continue to popularize K-pop internationally 
               
                   shows, the current spread of K-pop and South Korean entertainment, known as the Korean Wave,

                  <h3>POP</h3>
                  <p>Pop music is a genre of popular music that originated i
                      its modern form during the mid-1950s in the United States 
                      and the United Kingdom.[4] The terms popular music and pop 
                      music are often used interchangeably, although the former
                       describes all music that is popular and includes many disparat
                       e styles. During the 1950s and 1960s, pop music encompassed rock 
                       
                       and roll and the youth-oriented styles it influenced. Rock and pop
                       music remained roughly synonymous until the late 1960s, after which 
                       pop became associated with music that was more commercial, ephemeral, 
                       and accessible.</p>
